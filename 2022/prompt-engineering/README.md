# DALL-E 2 and Prompt Engineering

Hey, I've been writing fantasy novels. I've already published [the first one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BG49NBKG) and I recommend you read it! Sign up for [my author site newsletter](https://felker.page) while you're at it.

As part of this marketing campaign I've authored a series of posts with [illustrations of main characters](https://www.felker.page/p/a-motley-band-of-adventurers-illustrated). I've also done posts on [the royal family](https://www.felker.page/p/the-royalty-in-ernos-illustrated) and [the League of Sorceresses](#). I think this helps the reader imagine the characters and can provide more content for my reader base. 

While I've had the cover designed by a professional, I used [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) for these illustrations. Illustrations are rightly expensive, but I don't think I would've comissioned a bunch of them from an artist. My author budget is constrained, and I think there are higher-impact places to put my limited marketing funds than paid art.

Now that DALL-E 2 [is open for anyone](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist/), I thought generating a few illustrations could make good content and it does. In this "behind the scenes" post, I want to give my own experience with the tool and the broader concept of ["prompt engineering"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering).
