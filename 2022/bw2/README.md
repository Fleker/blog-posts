# Unpopular Opinion: B2 and W2 aren't good games

Just about ten years ago these sequels came out for the Nintendo DS, following up on the originals. I didn't buy either game at the time but overpaid for the games last summer and played through them for the first time. These games are seen by many for the high-water mark of the franchise. However, after beating the story and doing post-game quests, I found it wasn't really as good as people say.

## Old Pokémon Return

Black and White made the bold choice to only have new Pokémon in the wild. I thought this was cool at the time, a way to signal that this region was far away and to bring in a lot of fresh designs. Even though I didn't like every Pokémon, it was a bold choice.

Fans did not like this and so GameFreak pivoted sharply to usher in plenty of old Pokémon without any real explanation. Why have wild Pokémon changed so much in just a few years?

While an expanded dex usually comes with the second games of a generation, GF really goes overboard in this regard. They quickly cast the new Unovan Pokémon to the side to rush after nostalgia.
