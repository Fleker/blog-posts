# Unpopular Opinion: B2 and W2 aren't good games

Just about ten years ago these sequels came out for the Nintendo DS, following up on the originals. I didn't buy either game at the time but overpaid for the games last summer and played through them for the first time. These games are seen by many for the high-water mark of the franchise. However, after beating the story and doing post-game quests, I found it wasn't really as good as people say.

## Old Pokémon Return

Black and White made the bold choice to only have new Pokémon in the wild. I thought this was cool at the time, a way to signal that this region was far away and to bring in a lot of fresh designs. Even though I didn't like every Pokémon, it was a bold choice.

Fans did not like this and so GameFreak pivoted sharply to usher in plenty of old Pokémon without any real explanation. Why have wild Pokémon changed so much in just a few years?

While an expanded dex usually comes with the second games of a generation, GF really goes overboard in this regard. They quickly cast the new Unovan Pokémon to the side to rush after nostalgia. You start in Aspertia City, then go to Route 19 and 20 until you get to [Floccesy Ranch](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/unova/floccesyranch.shtml). While there are largely just Unovan Pokémon at the start, here is where the game starts to engage in revisionism. At the ranch you wind up finding Pokémon like Azurill, Mareep, and Riolu who evolve into fairly strong Pokémon. For trainers, this is a good place to build your final team using non-Unova Pokémon.

It sucks that they don't do justice to these Pokémon when they had just previously put such a spotlight on these new ones. Then there are some places like the [Castelia Sewers](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/unova/casteliasewers.shtml) which don't have Unovan Pokémon at all.

## Legendaries
[Legendary Pokémon](https://www.serebii.net/black2white2/legendary.shtml) in particular seem rather haphazardly placed in the game as well. I was surprised to encounter Cobalion just in the middle of a route even before I had all my badges. I caught it, but it was really weird to just see it there so early in the game. I had expected to get much farther along in my journey before considering that. I didn't, but could've placed it on my team and had a much better advantage against the in-game trainers.

Virizion and Terrakion are also just there in the overworld. For Unovan legendaries, I'm disappointed they don't even have a semblance of a story. There's not even something like a side-quest. The Lati twins also just appear in the post-game without any real rationale.

What's worse is that the other Unovan legendaries, the forces of nature, can't be caught at all. Of course this was in order to promote the [Dream Radar AR game](https://www.serebii.net/dreamradar/) that they required you to purchase separately. It seems bad in retrospect, particularly how once again the Unovan Pokémon don't get much care or attention for players of B2W2.

## Graphics
We should admit that the graphics in these games aren't great. The pixelated style does not work well with the pseudo-3D camera movements and it just higlights the flaws of using pixels. Particularly in some places, like the Skyarrow Bridge, this style does not work. In battles, the Pokémon have large blocks that grow and shrink as the camera moves around, but it rarely looks alright.

They do try a number of visual flourishes like adding lens flares when you walk outside or other particle effects in the overworld. Yet they don't really make the game look better as much as it looks busier.

## Gameplay
Busy rather than better seems to leak into the gameplay too. Pacing in the game feels off, and multiple times I'd have to go into the tall grass to grind my team several levels since I couldn't beat the local gym leader. I couldn't travel too far due to the large number of arbitrary barriers that were put in place to progress.

While I appreciated loosening the need for HMs, these obstacles would be replaced by clowns blocking gates just because they could. It's arbitrary and broke some of the immersion. I need to beat the gym leader? Fine, but at least give me a good reason. I think GF has continued to be weak in this area and I don't like it.

The worldbuilding in general feels strange. Drayden is now the 7th gym leader, still a Dragon-type user. Yet Iris becomes champion and is also a Dragon-type trainer? One of those two should've been replaced to add a little more variety.

## Worldbuilding
This game introduces a number of new locations to the region, such as Aspertia City, but without a lot of justification. Why was this place inaccessible before? Why was Virbank City inaccessible before? I get the urge to add new places to make the region exciting to explore again, but as a sequel it's hard to say this place always existed but you can't visit it. Lentimas Town seems the strangest addition of all, adding nothing useful as far as I can tell to the story or the world.

## Is this all there is?
As I got to the endgame, travelling all the way back to Route 1 and 2, I battled [a handful of trainers](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/unova/route2.shtml#trainers-bw2). By Gen 5 it was clear that there were certain themes in each generation. We'd have a regional rodent, bird, bug, etc. Youngster Jimmy has all five rodents. Lass Mali has all five birds. As I grinded through each fight, it gave me a bad feeling. It made me think that the future was just going to be formulaic forever.

B2W2 are sequels, admittedly different from the "third version" we'd expected. Still, the game comes across as lacking boldness and inventiveness. Similar to previous generations, it focuses on the third legendary. We got another 100 base stat mythical, and it seems like this could just continue on until the franchise burns out.

The games are still 2D. They are still on a grid system. They add more things like hidden grottos and triple battles, but nothing feels fundamentally better to play.

Of course that's not what happens. Gen 6 brings a new 3D world with freer movement and mega evolutions. There is no Pokémon Z, though there could've been, and X & Y do feel like a fresh game in a few ways. Of course, they have their own flaws that can be discussed, but it does feels more inventive than B2W2.

People will defend the fifth generation as having the best story, and perhaps that's true. However, in terms of creating a fun and enjoyable game B2W2 feel like a step down compared to their predecessors.
