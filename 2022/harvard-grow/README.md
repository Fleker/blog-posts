# It's time for Harvard to grow up, and double the school size

Harvard has girlbossed too close to the sun.

Is there anything morally wrong? How does one define 'bigoted'? These aren't just abstract questions anymore, as the institution of affirmative action is likely to get dismissed by Harvard after last week the Supreme Court heard [Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College
](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/students-for-fair-admissions-inc-v-president-fellows-of-harvard-college/), in which the plantiff seeks to dismantle racial preferences entirely as a method to admit students.

To be clear, I am of the opinion that this is entirely the fault of Harvard (UNC shares some blame too) for creating too hostile an environment to well-deserving students. Their hostility towards better education will now hurt many minority communities unless they can find proxies for race, which is not actually that easy.

The legality of affirmative action was held up in 2003 in [Grutter v Bollinger](https://casetext.com/case/grutter-v-bollinger-et-al) when the majority opinion stated that 25 years from that point:

> the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.

It was clear that affirmative action was never going to last forever, and universities like Harvard should've taken that chance to be prepared for the day it was struck down.

## Affirmative Action works

The entire point of the case reflects on the harms that affirmative action has to minority groups. The plantiffs are successful students of [largely of Asian descent](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/) who say race played a role in being rejected from the college.

Why do we even have affirmative action? It has had [a positive effect](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-affirmative-action-had-to-go) on integrating Black Americans into the larger society. [Several studies have shown benefits](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/94/4/1107/58016/Does-Temporary-Affirmative-Action-Produce).

> We find that AA increased black employment at all ranks by 4.5 to 6.2 percentage points relative to national trends. We also find no erosion of these employment gains in the fifteen years following AA termination, although black employment growth was significantly lower in departments after AA ended than in departments whose plans continued.

Studies suggest that affirmative action can provide minority students more confidence and motivation to succeed. Although by 'minority group' we mean Black Americans mainly. And it is important that we can find ways to everyone to succeed and build systems that maintain this progress.

## But you shouldn't pit people against each other

One study suggests that the number of Black students admitted to Harvard will be slashed roughly by two-thirds, a sharp cut. This will also hurt Hispanic students slightly. But this may have large benefits for Asian students, whose acceptances will grow by about half.

Asians will be 37% of [a paltry 3% of applicants](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/4/1/admissions-class-of-2026/) that are accepted to Harvard. Each student class is barely even 2000 students. So in absolute terms the student population will roughly go from 280 to 80 Black students and from 480 to 740 Asian students.

The biggest problem in this math is pitting various people against each other. With only 2,000 seats and 60,000 applications of course you're going to get people who will see this as a zero-sum game. If a Black student gets accepted, an Asian student doesn't. In that kind of world, of course they were going to file a lawsuit. Harvard's devotion to gatekeeping set the conditions to ruin race-concious admissions for every other college in the country, because the rest of them weren't setting the competitive temperature so high.

## Harvard's net education

Is Harvard actually a good school? Many would say it's excellent. If that's the case, it seems immoral that they would only allow so few to have access to it. Affirmative action is often painted as some sort of generosity, but admitting _only 280 Black students_ each year sounds stingy. On the net, do they actually do more good the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/about-ucf/facts/), which has about thirty times more Black students?

Put another way, does a Harvard education make a Black student thirty times more successful than a student from UCF? Maybe. But then that becomes an optimization question. If Harvard accepted 560 Black students, would they be fifteen times more successful or more? If we could quantity success somehow, how many Black students should Harvard accept to maximize net success? Find that number and then admit that many students.

## We should double the population of Harvard

Let's say after all our math it turns out that we find the optimal number of students. Harvard cannot tweak the racial percentages to achieve that number of Black students. One easy way to get around this is to actually increase the size of the university. It would be fairly easy! Harvard only accepts 2000 students each year.

If they accepted 4000 students, that would still be a fairly small number.
