# Things I want to see in a BW Remake

GameFreak follows and eschews a variety of patterns. Ever since Platinum, we never really had a "third version". After B2W2 we never got sequels in Kalos. We got two remasters in USUM. Sword and Shield brought us DLC rather than a whole new game. Still, one pattern that seems likely to continue are remakes of past games of each generation.

A remaster or remake of Black and White could be a great opportunity to really rebuild the Unova region in a more immersive 3D environment that feels modern. We could wind up with a rather milquetoast BW remake and a Legends: Kyurem game. I really can't predict what will happen next.

But after living in New York City for a few years, there's definitely a few things I'd like to see them add to make Unova a better game.

I want to make sure I look at this through the lens of game development. While it'd be cool to have a fully realized Manhattan like in the Spiderman games, that seems unrealistic.

Why would game developers add something new to a game? There are a few reasons: worldbuilding, game mechanics, and novelty. These three can help sell the game, increase engagement, improve replayability.

## Worldbuilding

Castelia City is meant to resemble downtown Manhattan but they don't do very much here. Aside from a few avenues there are relatively few things that feel like Manhattan.

I'd like to see this city expanded to better resemble acutal Manhattan. To the north of Castelia City is a miniscule park which I guess is meant to resemble Central Park. Yet Central Park is a large place with plenty of nature and scenic views.

A larger Castelia Park would include many more environments such as a lake, field, forest, and even some rockier areas. You can easily get lost in the ramble of Central Park and turning it more into a nature preserve or Safari Park would improve replayability. Central Park has famous birds including a bald eagle.
[The park you get in B2W2](https://www.serebii.net/pokearth/unova/casteliacity.shtml#bw-park) is not a good analogue.

Manhattan has a lot of parks. Green space starts at [Battery Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Manhattan)) at the bottom and goes up the west side with a bike trail that takes you [all the way to Canada](https://empiretrail.ny.gov/).
It'd make a good bike-only trail where you could find a number of marine Pokemon and battle other cyclists.

Just adding more parks interspersed in-between buildings could be good places to hide rare Pokemon encounters or items.

Manhattan has a lot of statues and monuments as well, as a place with a lot of history and culture. Central Park has a number of statues depicting historical figures.
This would be another good opportunity for worldbuilding. Add statues depicting historical characters in the game. Perhaps a young Oak won some award. Maybe the ancestor of a gym leader is memorialized. Professor Laventon has some connection with Unova.
There are many characters you could include which would make the world feel richer.

## Game Mechanics

The small NYC parks provides places for rare Pokemon to appear, but there are also other mechanics that could make the game more interesting.

Take for instance the Battle Subway, which just takes you in a circle or to Anville Town. The subways in New York City stretch out to much of the expanded boroughs and it'd neat to lean into that more.

The subways could serve like the S.S. Anne, where you can battle a handful of trainers before arriving at your journey.

New York City also has a lot of museums, in particular [the Museum Mile](https://www.nycgo.com/museums-galleries/museum-mile-upper-east-side) as a notable place.
Lenora has just one historical museum, but there's so many other museums that could exist. Adding in more of these museums for different fields could add not just to worldbuilding but also
improve gameplay. These could be locations where you are given side-quests to obtain rare items.
Alternatively, you could be sent on scavenger hunts where the clues are items in some of these museums. You need to find a particular statue, fossil, artwork, or other item to win.
These hunts could become timed and competitive with multiplayer.

## Novelty

Adding novelty to a game helps it stand out and can make the game feel fresh or the world feel immersive. New York City has a lot of opportunities.
There are many small newsstands along the streets of Manhattan where vendors can sell items conveniently. Bodegas are also small corner shops that can sell items.
Small marts could replace or augment the existing general marts that we're familiar with.

Bodegas could sell exclusive items like particular PokeBalls. You could have a Kanto-themed store that sells particular novelty items like Pewter Crunchies.
Newsstands might sell a rotating collection of particular items like Razor Fangs and Razor Claws.

Overall, I found the New York City depicted in Unova to be a good start. There are a number of things that were included.
However, GameFreak didn't always execute perfectly when it came to the smaller details. If we do get a Black and White remake, made in a modern Unova,
I hope that they take the time to reconsider the region and improve upon it. Not just for my sake, but to improve worldbuilding, game mechanics, and novelty.
