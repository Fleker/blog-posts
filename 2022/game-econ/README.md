# Game Economies: Single-Use TMs, Raids, and Crafting

Sometimes it feels like we're going backwards with the news that Techincal Machines have reverted to being a one-time use item.
Rather than being able to teach all of our Pokemon, not worrying about inventory, we need to wind up stocking a bunch of them. I know I'll be hoarding them.

However, the reason for this makes sense if you think about the larger economy within the game. TMs are valuable and it makes sense that these be
used as a way to encourage replayability long past the post-game. They're not making them impossible or even hard to get, but it does mean you need to keep playing.

Sword and Shield introduced Max Raid battles as a fun way to spend a few minutes. After winning a raid, you are able to get a number of items including berries, exp candies, and technical records.
These TRs add another 100 moves that Pokemon can learn, but are also consumable. The TRs tend to be related to the raid boss, giving you some reason to pick particular raids.

At a certain point you may no longer want to catch tese raid bosses. It seems reasonable that after two or three there'd be no more reason to keep doing them. 
It's these consumable rewards that keep people playing. The more items that exist, the longer you need to play. But it's not grinding the same dungeon over and over.
Your target matters. In a larger world you have to pick how you spend your time grinding.

I wouldn't be surprised if TMs return as rewards for defeating a raid. It gives a reason to keep battling in them, although you won't be required to grind raids.
The TM Machine introduces a crafting mechanic. Looking at the brief clip in the recent trailer, there are at least 130. I wouldn't be surprised if there were 200 in total.

Each TM requires league points, which don't seem hard to get. They also require particular crafting items for each TM.
Icy Wind requires Snom and Snover droppings. You can get these items after defeating these specific Pokemon in the wild. I'm sure they'll also be rewards from raids.

The reason for this is to stretch out the game economy and limit the value of hoarding.
You could spend hours in the snow and wind up with a hundred Snom items but that doesn't help you out too much. You could make a hundred Icy Wind TMs
but you won't be able to do much else. This discourages mindless grinding and keeps players engaged on a variety of smaller goals. Still, you will
be able to exchange excess materials for league points so these won't be wasted.

After playing the game for a while, you'll end up with more things than you know what to do with.
After about 250 hours of Legends Arceus I've got close to 2000 Great Balls and very little reason to use them. I could sell them, but then there's
not much to do with my money. Every game economy faces this problem, particuarly for people like me who tend to hoarde things. The sign of a good
game economy is for this economy to make sense for as long as possible. This means creating a wide variety of items that all have particular uses,
easily obtainable through a wide variety of game tasks, and consumable.

Something I need to understand is that the game does have some measure of abundance. I should feel free to teach any Pokemon I want Icy Wind.
I shouldn't worry about running out of TMs. It's actually not hard to get another one. In fact, it seems like there'll be a number of ways to get
the same item.

I'm sure by the time I get 250 hours into the game I'll have far too many Icy Wind TMs.
