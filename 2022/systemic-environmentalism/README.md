- AI is a paperclip maximizer: https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/paperclip-maximizer
- Environment is too important to be left to environmentalists
- [Systemic racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism) looks at problems within a larger societal system. This needs to be true for environment too.

## NEPA
- Permit reform isn't happening this Congress
- It's needed to actually build the things we are paying for: https://twitter.com/HandNF/status/1600903072745943040
- Biden agrees: https://twitter.com/AlecStapp/status/1583545801619386369
- What's next? [Republican-controlled house will do it](https://www.eenews.net/articles/manchins-last-gasp-permitting-effort-fails/) with a less green focus, so congrats.
- EU needs to import LNG to fight facsim: https://www.slowboring.com/p/let-joe-manchin-have-his-pipeline
- Nuclear energy has halted since 1970: https://www.discoursemagazine.com/ideas/2022/12/07/we-need-an-abundance-agenda/
    - No development while coal continued (graph for this?)
    - Nuclear is very safe (deaths/kW?)

> The examples are numerous and absurd — the Forest Service’s wildfire prevention projects are delayed an average of 3.5 to 7.2 years due to NEPA.  In one instance a wildfire prevention plan was delayed so long that the impacted forest, which wasn’t aware of the importance of bureaucratic process, caught fire and burned 90,000 acres to the ground while the plan to stop said wildfire was still in review.

## Transit
- NYC takes public transit. That's very good (And green!) https://twitter.com/TheOmniZaddy/status/1468092000893386756
- Now the MTA is facing a major budget crunch and is lookng to raise prices or cut service: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/11/nyregion/new-york-subway-fare-mta.html
- Congestion pricing is taking too long: https://twitter.com/HandNF/status/1569860341802082304
- fewer trains means more cars means more asthma: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/traffic-pollution-and-asthma/
- And ~5m people die annually from air pollution: https://ourworldindata.org/data-review-air-pollution-deaths
- It's not fair to point to any specific driver and say they're killing a person
- Oil prices can make alternatives more compelling: https://twitter.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1506380202208907274
- That's why the _system_ matters

## YIMBYism
- Gentrification is caused by NIMBYism: https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1601002451750031360
    - This guy wants to get a home in his neighborhood but cannot. Now he must go someplace affordable (poorer neighborhood)
    - Then stores and services appear in his new neighborhood to cater to him. That's to be expected.
- Suburbs are legal but there's damage to suburban sprawl
    - These low density communities then lead to more car pollution
- Communities, particular rich ones, block renewable energy. But then where does it go? https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertbryce/2021/09/26/heres-the-list-of-317-wind-energy-rejections-the-sierra-club-doesnt-want-you-to-see/?sh=7470fd715bad

> Wind projects are never going to be built in places like Marin, Malibu, or Montauk. Folks in those places can afford to hire powerful lawyers and lobbyists. Instead, Big Wind always aims their projects at low-income counties where the opponents don’t have as much money to fight back. That’s true of Shasta County. Of the 58 counties in California, Shasta County ranks 46th in median household income. According to the Census Bureau, the median household income in Shasta County is about $54,700. That’s far less than the California average of about $75,200. 

- Even environmental organizations are against renewable energy: https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/americas-top-environmental-groups
    - Oh you want to build it, but where? 

- https://www.audubon.org/news/national-audubon-society-sues-california-county-improve-bird-protections

> “Audubon supports responsibly developed wind projects and works collaboratively with wind developers that are authentically interested in avoiding impacts to birds, but we have been forced to file this lawsuit because Alameda County has broken its commitments and failed to protect birds and bats in the Altamont Pass for forty years,” said Mike Lynes, California state policy director for the National Audubon Society. “Alameda County approved a poorly planned project that they know will kill Golden Eagles and other birds in violation of state and federal laws and that will contribute to the continuing declines of Golden Eagles and other sensitive species."

- But what if there is no solar? Is more air pollution good for birds? There are trade-offs, but do we have time for perfection?

- https://www.audubon.org/news/audubons-new-climate-report-and-what-it-means-birds-arid-west

> Audubon just released a new scientific report, Survival by Degrees, showing that 64 percent (389 out of 604) of North American bird species are at risk of extinction from climate change. The good news is our science also shows that if we take action now we can help improve the chances for 76 percent of species at risk. We know what to do to protect the birds we love and the places we all need now and in the future.

- Will a few birds die to save the rest? This is a genuinely tough choice, but we can't keep kicking the can down the road. Because inaction is a choice too.
