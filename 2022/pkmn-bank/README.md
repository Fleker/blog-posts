# GameFreak is anticipating the shutdown of Pokemon Bank

Since Gen 3 it's been possible to bring your favorite Pokemon with you. It hasn't always been trivial, but I've got Pokemon in Home right now
from my original Sapphire cartridge.

This is quite cool, and something that doesn't really happen in other game franchises. However, in recent times we've been relying on servers
to store our Pokemon, putting things at risk for deprecation.

The 3DS shops are shutting down payments [in late March next year](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/57847/~/wii-u-%26-nintendo-3ds-eshop-discontinuation-q%26a).
While you'll still be able to download free software, it is clear that Nintendo is shutting down the platform. This leaves Bank in an odd place.
It is a free piece of software, but requires a $5/year subscription. Will it still be possible to use Bank after shutdown?

Will Pokemon Bank shutdown at some point? It seems likely, and that means that you won't be able to transfer Pokemon out of your DS and 3DS games anymore.
Barring any sort of alternative, it means that your Pokemon will be stuck in these games.

From a macro perspective, it does mean that some Pokemon [won't be usable in any recent game](https://www.reddit.com/r/TruePokemon/comments/sjopl2/gen_8_retrospective_what_pok%C3%A9mon_are_missing/).
While I could catch a lot of Minior in Sun and trade them to others using Home, that may not be possible at a certain point. Since I also can't move
Minior to SwSh or BDSP, I won't be able to breed them. It creates a very odd scarcity in some Pokemon.

Looking at trailers for the games, we've seen a lot of these Pokemon return. Gogoat, Pyroar, and a number of others are confirmed to return. I believe
that GameFreak is bringing these back especially since they haven't appeared on the Switch yet and they need a way for players to catch them once
Bank inevitably shuts down.

[CentroLEAKS](https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1579706742409424897) on Twitter has tweeted that certain Pokemon still won't appear in Scarlet/Violet.
The tweet lists them, so that may be considered a spoiler. If their tweet is true, that would be a shame. It's been a while since they've appeared and
it would be a problem if Bank were to close without a way to catch any of these and bring them forward.

I'd be remiss not to include Pokemon Go as an alternative avenue, since it is possible to catch many of these Pokemon today and move them to Home.
However, Go still has many regional exclusives and seasonal spawns that makes this non-trivial.

If there are any common (non-legendary) Pokemon that cannot be caught in any Switch, my bet is that Bank will remain active. However, if some hypothetical
S/V DLC does finish the list, it would be a signal that Bank is ready to be sunset.
